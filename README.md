# MinecraftFiles & Utils
A library of files pre-alpha(1.1.2 -1.2.6) to now (semi current).
  - mods, jars, utils, worlds, saves, maps, etc
This small base of files was built because I enjoy playing with old worlds and builds 
however a lot of links are dead or dying these days. This is my attempt to group them up.
#Any of the mods and texture-packs etc are not made by me unless said in the credits 
#all rights and trademarks belong to the rightful owners

To be added: Folder of Jar files for server and client for alpha and beta builds (you will need to create your own bat files to run these on windows)
