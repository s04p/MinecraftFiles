Rules:

	1. Do not break any block other than sand, clay, gravel
	or spawners unless otherwise directed.
	
	2. You may use any items found in chests for crafting, but 
	please do not use items from other sources (monster drops
	are acceptable but crafting tnt would be cheating).

	3. Collect diamonds to increase your score. You may use any
	you find to craft diamond weapons, tools or armour if you run
	into trouble, but this will decrease your final score.

	4. This map is designed to be played on normal or above, but 
	you do not have to fight monsters if you do not want to.

	5. You may not craft levers or pressure plates.
